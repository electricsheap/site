								Research Plan and Methodology
							</h1>
							
							<p>
								This study utilized qualitative research methodology, and specifically, a narrative inquiry approach (Riessman 2008). There are many different ways to conduct narrative qualitative research. Riessman’s approach is thematic in nature. Thematic narrative approaches to qualitative research “center around the idea that individuals live storied lives, and by recollecting these stories, they make meaning of their lives. Thus, the stories told are analyzed through an inductive process to identify themes of a storyline and represented as such, (Bhattacharya, 2017, p. 94). This approach feels appropriate for my research, as I plan to analyze the specific experiences of teachers and their students as they traverse music education in a virtual landscape. By telling their story, I hope to shed light on the many personal and interpersonal struggles educators go through when adjusting.
							</p>


							<h1>
								Research Plan
							</h1>
							
							<h2>
								Main Question: 
							</h2>

							<p>
							    How have music educators navigated the COVID 19 pandemic and resulting school closures and partial re-openings, what barriers have they faced, and what strategies have they employed that they deem to be most useful?
							</p>

							<h2>
								Purpose Statement
							</h2>
							<p>
							    The purpose of my research is to help identify the struggles and improve the quality of music education in a virtual classroom, with the mindset that music education has a  positive impact on students.
							</p>

							<h2>
								Community impact 
							</h2>
							<p>
							    My research is particularly relevant right now, as many schools are teaching virtually in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been at the price of several music programs, and music education as a whole is suffering. My research should help improve the quality of music education for the community of music educators and students.
							</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><em>
								How do you identify and define the community that is potentially involved with, and affected by, your inquiry? 
							</em></p>
							<p>
							    I plan to use the PKY website to find a list of active music education classes. I also plan to ask close peers for examples of students who were in music courses last year but not this year. This widens the perspective of the community further.
							</p>

 
							<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><em>
								How does your plan to create visible efforts/events that you facilitate promote collaboration?
							</em></p>
							<p>
							    I plan to email music teachers to facilitate interviews with music students. I also plan to message several teachers and peers directly to ask for more in depth interviews.
							</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><em>
								How do you define and describe your plan of action to promote involvement, engagement, and transparency with your community?
							</em></p>
							<p>
							    My plan involves teachers giving out a survey which includes information about what the answers are being used for. Students will be required to understand this before they are able to answer the questions, which prevents students from answering questions they may not be comfortable answering in some situations.
							</p>

Research timeline

    By October 5th:
        Finish the bulk of literature review
        In order to get a grasp on who is in the community, I will see which music classes are currently open on the PKY website. Those classes are the ones directly affected by my research, so I plan to ask music teachers to give a short survey to their students (perhaps for extra credit to give incentive). The survey would ask generally how their music education experiences have changed since the shift toward virtual schooling, how their experience has worsened or improved, and how they feel it can become better. I would make it clear that the purpose of the survey is to use student experiences as a guide to improve virtual music education.
    By October 19th
        Create more in depth interview questions for specific people such as peers I have close contact with and pky music teachers and try to arrange meetings. I would first clarify with the interviewee how their response will be analyzed to improve help improve virtual music education.
    By November 2nd
        By this point I will have finished collecting my surveys and hopefully conducted my interviews.
        I can move on to interpreting the responses I get qualitatively
    By November 16th
        Hopeful estimate for the completion of my research

 

Critical Friends and Peer Support

    Several of my close friends are currently taking music education classes at PKY. I will likely ask for their input. Plus, they know other students who take music classes, which can help me contact the right people.
    A few of my friends took music classes last year as well, which will give good context for what the transition into virtual schooling was like when teachers had much less time to plan.
    My Mother was once a music teacher, and is currently PhD professor in the field of education. She will be great aid to my research in all regards. -->
