							<h1>
								Ethical Review
							</h1>

							<h3>
								Who will your participants be? Describe briefly their general characteristics (age, background, geographical location). Why have you chosen these participants? How will you contact them and get them interested? How will you secure their "informed consent"?  Include the “informed consent” document you will share with participants.
							</h3>
							<p>
								My participants will be PK Young middle and high school students who are currently or have been enrolled in a music class since the switch to virtual schooling last year, as well as PK Yonge music educators currently working at the school. I plan to incentivize students and teachers with the knowledge that their participation will help improve their music education experience, for both teachers and their students.
							</p>
							<br>

							<br>

							
							
							<h3>
								How will you contact your participants?  
							</h3>
							<p>
								The music teachers will be contacted directly from me by email. I will ask them to give my survey to their students. A will also contact several peers directly via email and instant message.
							</p>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>



							
							<h3>
								What will you ask your research participants to do (a.k.a. methodology and activities)?  Include draft survey, interview, or focus group questions.
							</h3>
							<p>
								I will ask teachers to be interviewed by me.
							</p>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>



							 
							<h3>
								Is there anything you will do that will expose the participants to psychological, physical, or environmental stressors, risks, or harms greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life? (e.g. Ethical concerns such as awakening old disturbing memories or creating further stigma by singling out specific persons in a marginalized social group). 
							</h3>
							<p>
								No
							</p>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>




							<h3>
								Will participants be identified in the final product? Or, will their anonymity be maintained? Please explain. 
							</h3>
							<p>
								All interviewees will remain completely anonymous, with pseudonyms. 
							</p>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>




							<h3>
								What, if any, is your formal training or lived experience in this area? How will you prepare for these activities (interviews, surveys, focus groups, etc.) 
							</h3>							
							<p>
								I have been a part of music education at PK Yonge since my ninth grade year. I also experienced the switch from in person to virtual classrooms first hand, all of which gives me context for the subject of my research.
							</p>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>




							<h3>
								What have you read or will be reading about research methods that will help you conduct the interviews, focus groups, other activities, analysis, etc.? (You can start with basic "how to" guides).  
							</h3>
							<p>
								Several PDFs provided by Dr. Haas Moskowitz, which outline how various types of research is conducted.
							</p>
							<br>
							<hr>
							<br>
								



							 
							<h3>
								What will you give back to persons or communities that participate in your research? (e.g. Plain language reports, community presentations in PowerPoint, photo exhibit, etc.).
							</h3>
							<p>
								I will create a PAR paper and poster presentation outlining their lived experiences and how they help find ways to improve virtual music education.
