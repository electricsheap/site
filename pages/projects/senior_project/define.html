							<h1>How I Define Myself</h1>

							<p>
								My identity is based heavily on my upbringing and my parenthood. My parents are both kind and accepting people, and in many ways they have taught me to be the same. I like to believe that I enter most conflicts giving the benefit of the doubt. I think that trusting in othersâ€™ good faith is key to any confrontation. Many times I find that when I give benefit of the doubt, it gives me a more balanced and objective perspective. Hopefully this will allow me to view my research through an unbiased lens.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course there are still unavoidable identities I have to be aware of. I am a white male. Personally, I do not consider either of these as strong elements of my identity; while I am comfortable as a man, I am somewhat indifferent to traditional masculine behaviors and traits, nor do I feel too attached to my heritage as a white European.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								However, my identity is not entirely up to me, as my gender and racy carry weight, and I am responsible for that. As a white person, I try to recognize how oppressed groups feel around me, and aim to make them feel safe. During my research, I will inevitably encounter my own unconscious bias. I hope to counter this with conscientious and careful consideration of the repercussions of my words.
