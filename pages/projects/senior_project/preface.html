							<h1>Essential Question</h1>
							<p>
								How have music educators navigated the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting school closures and partial re-openings, what barriers have they faced, and what strategies have they employed that they deem to be most useful?
							</p>

							<h1>Rational</h1>
							<p>
								I have been interested in creating music since the seventh grade. Since then, I have never learned a single instrument, nor have I ever been in a standard band class. A traditional marching band or symphonic band has never interested me, but since ninth grade, I have been part of a ‘rock band’ class in which we group into several small bands and play a selection of modern music genres. I have heard that this sort of class is beneficial in ways a traditional music class is not. This got me thinking about the impact of music education on students in general. Using a website called MindMup, I created a mindmap of various subjects surrounding music education. One path of thought which particularly interested me was the effect of COVID-19 on music education. Clearly, virtual school suppresses the effectiveness of music education, but this got me wondering in what tactics schools could employ to better teach music education virtually.
