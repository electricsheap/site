Pricing:



ambient drone: $25
any reasonable length, as long as it doesn't need to dramatically evolve.
you may, of course, give specification / example tracks for your desired sound.

ambient drone evolving: $35
for tracks which change significantly over the course of 2+ minutes.

    ex:

ambient melodic: $35 for 2 minutes
for ambient tracks which contain melodic progressions beyond just a few notes. The line between this and drone can be a bit blurry at times, and I will typically be lenient. However, most of the time, you know if this is what you want against drone.

    ex:
    https://soundcloud.com/electricsheap/long-paths-and-large-hats?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing 


chiptune and vgm: $40 for 2 minutes 

other: $xx
I don't feel confident enough in many other broad genres to morally take commission atm. That being said, if you have a specific request based of track you've heard from me in the past, or just want to try me, shoot me a request and I can give you a pricing.
