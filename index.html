<h1> <em>about me ...</em> </h1>
<p>
    Andrew Wilson goes by many names online, primarily due to his indecisiveness. Some of these aliases include chronologic_error, chr_err, electric_sheap, andrew_man. Nowadays, he uses the alias "AJCW"; he likes that one the best!
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of superficial titles and labels, Andrew has had a passion for making music since the eighth grade! After a few months of posting his music to SoundCloud, he had saved enough money to purchase his first and primary DAW, Ableton Live.
</p>
<p>
    Around this time, Andrew's good friend Alex Casanas had been delving into filmmaking, and needed music! Alongside this, he was integrating himself into a community of producers in the C418 discord server, collaborating and contributing to several remix challenges. Some of these early influences are still reflected in his music today, as these opportunities gave Andrew an artistic direction he would need to truly develop his production style.
</p>
<p>
    Other than this, Andrew has many other inspirations. He has always enjoyed the raw melodic emotion in many tracks deadmau5 tracks. The mau5's dedication to sound-design-from-scratch gave Andrew an early advantage in the realm of sound design and audio engineering as a whole. Andrew has adopted the textural tendencies seen in music by Chris Clark, Aphex Twin, and Mr. Bill. However, let's not discount Andrew's love for Video Game soundtracks and their influence. Game OSTs such as Rain World (James Primate), Minecraft (C418), Outer Wilds (Andrew Prahlow), Undertale (Toby Fox), and Celeste (Lena Raine), have forever impacted how Andrew creates music for all forms of visual mediums.
</p>
<p>
    Today, Andrew is channeling his creative efforts primarily on collaborative projects. He works with multiple amateurs filmmakers (many in the youtube horror scene), a few video game modders, and even on a few indie games. That being said, he is hard at work on his stand-alone studio album: All Your Care. More singles will release as the album approaches completion!
