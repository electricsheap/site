								This is a short album I made for a mod to the game Hearts of Iron. The mod takes place in an alternate timeline, in which the invention of wireless electricity causes science to advance at a much different pace. Although the songs do not play over any specific scenes, I tried to tell some sort of a story.

								Even before the Monument Mythos or the House in the Ocean, Alex Casanas made a lot of sort films. Throughout middle and high school, I would give him music to use in said films. This album is a collection of the best of those songs up until its release. I honestly do not how each song was used, or what they were for, but I'm glad I made them!

<h1> <em>about me ...</em> </h1>
<p>
	Andrew Wilson goes by many names online, primarily due to his indecisiveness. Some of these aliases include chronologic_error, chr_err, electric_sheap, andrew_man. Nowadays, he uses the alias "AJCW"; he likes that one the best!
</p>
<p>
	Despite any indecisiveness with his title, Andrew was confident in his passion for making music since the eighth grade! Starting out using a free program called SoundTrap, Andrew would post his first songs to SoundCloud. Eventually he had saved enough money to purchase his first and primary DAW, Ableton Live.
</p>
<p>
	Around this time, Andrew's good friend Alex Casanas had been delving into filmmaking, and needed music! Alongside this, he was integrating himself into a various communities of producers in the C418 discord server. These factors ignited Andrew's passion for collaboration. Other than this, Andrew has many other inspirations. He has always enjoyed the raw melodic emotion in many deadmau5 tracks. The mau5's dedication to sound-design-from-scratch gave Andrew an early advantage in the realm of sound design and audio engineering as a whole. Andrew has also adopted the textural tendencies seen in music by Chris Clark, Aphex Twin, and Mr. Bill. However, let's not discount Andrew's love for Video Game soundtracks and their influence. Game OSTs such as Rain World (James Primate), Minecraft (C418), Outer Wilds (Andrew Prahlow), Undertale (Toby Fox), and Celeste (Lena Raine), have forever impacted how Andrew creates music for all forms of visual media.
</p>
<p>
	Today, Andrew is channeling his creative efforts primarily on collaborative projects. He works with multiple amateurs filmmakers (many in the youtube horror scene) and a few indie games. That being said, he is hard at work on his stand-alone studio album: All Your Care. More singles will release as the album approaches completion!
</p>
