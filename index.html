									This was originally going to be my debut album. I released the single "Bullhog" in 2020. Evidently, it took longer than I anticipated. Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by how some use meditation to gain greater control over their mind. I envy these people. I was told one way to practice is to think of a blank piece of paper. Try it! (listen to the album first tho lol)

<h1> <em>about me ...</em> </h1>
<!-- <p>
	Andrew Wilson goes by many names online, primarily due to his indecisiveness. Some of these aliases include chronologic_error, chr_err, electric_sheap, andrew_man. Nowadays, he uses the alias "AJCW"; he likes that one the best!
</p>
<p>
	Despite any indecisiveness with his title, Andrew was confident in his passion for making music since the eighth grade! Starting out using a free program called SoundTrap, Andrew would post his first songs to SoundCloud. Eventually he had saved enough money to purchase his first and primary DAW, Ableton Live.
</p>
<p>
	Around this time, Andrew's good friend Alex Casanas had been delving into filmmaking, and needed music! Alongside this, he was integrating himself into a various communities of producers in the C418 discord server. These factors ignited Andrew's passion for collaboration. Other than this, Andrew has many other inspirations. He has always enjoyed the raw melodic emotion in many deadmau5 tracks. The mau5's dedication to sound-design-from-scratch gave Andrew an early advantage in the realm of sound design and audio engineering as a whole. Andrew has also adopted the textural tendencies seen in music by Chris Clark, Aphex Twin, and Mr. Bill. However, let's not discount Andrew's love for Video Game soundtracks and their influence. Game OSTs such as Rain World (James Primate), Minecraft (C418), Outer Wilds (Andrew Prahlow), Undertale (Toby Fox), and Celeste (Lena Raine), have forever impacted how Andrew creates music for all forms of visual media.
</p>
<p>
	Today, Andrew is channeling his creative efforts primarily on collaborative projects. He works with multiple amateurs filmmakers (many in the youtube horror scene) and a few indie games. That being said, he is hard at work on his stand-alone studio album: All Your Care. More singles will release as the album approaches completion!

<p>I have made music since the 8th grade. I like it a bunch!</p>

							<h3><strong>I will make music for your game: </strong><em>Price varies</em></h3>
							<p>
								if you want more than one song for use in an officially release game, i can work with you to work out a price. Generally, I prefer to get a percentage of profit over a one time commission, but we can work out specifics one on one.
								<div class="example"></div>
								</div>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3><strong>ambient drone: </strong><em>$25</em></h3>
							<p>
								any reasonable length, as long as it doesn't need to dramatically evolve. you may, of course, give specification / example tracks for your desired sound.
								<div class="example">
									<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1134399667&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
								</div>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3><strong>ambient drone evolving: </strong><em>$35</em></h3>
							<p>
								for tracks which change significantly over the course of 2+ minutes.
								<div class="example">
									<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/628598148&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
								</div>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3><strong>ambient melodic: </strong><em>$35 for 2 minutes</em></h3>
							<p>
								for ambient tracks which contain melodic progressions beyond just a few notes. the line between this and drone can be a bit blurry at times, and i will typically be lenient. however, most of the time, you know if this is what you want. each extra minute is $5. <em>NOTE:</em> the two minutes does not include looped content; IE the track below would only be 1:30 in my eyes as it loop once.
								<div class="example">
									<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1151665351&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
								</div>
							</p>
							<br>
							<h3><strong>other: </strong><em>$XX</em></h3>
							<p>
								i don't feel confident enough in many other broad genres to morally take commission atm. that being said, if you have a specific request based of track you've heard from me in the past, or just want to try me, shoot me a request and i can give you a pricing.

											This was a project I worked on as part of the DevLup community at UF. I composed and produced a handful of songs, as well as several SFX. Although the project has yet to be finished, it gave me valuable experience with Unreal Engine and its audio systems.

											Pax Britannica is a mod for the map-based alternate history game called Hearts of Iron. I was unfamiliar with the game when I was asked to make a soundtrack for the mod, but after some research in into the game and the mod, I was up to the challenge. Similar to the Minecraft soundtrack, this music was not going to play in any particular order. Thusly, my main goal when making this music was to capture the bio-mechanical soundscape as well as the horrific tragedy of war, all while keeping the tone somewhat level throughout each track. Hopefully, the calm-yet-haunting music will allow the player to self-reflect on their actions.
